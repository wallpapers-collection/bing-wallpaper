What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift, and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.", "date": "Jun 24, 2025", "bsTitle": "Nature took its time", "quiz": "/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250624_DelicateArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ", "wp": true, "hsh": "f40b1f144417b63cf81656fc58de6a7a", "drk": 1, "top": 1, "bot": 1, "hs": []}, {"startdate": "20250623", "fullstartdate": "202506230700", "enddate": "20250624", "url": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DresdenElbe_EN-US2259441179_UHD.jpg&rf=LaDigue_UHD.jpg&pid=hp&w=3840&h=2160&rs=1&c=4", "urlbase": "/th?id=OHR.DresdenElbe_EN-US2259441179", "copyright": "The Elbe in Dresden, Germany (© Sean Pavone/Getty Images)", "copyrightlink": "/search?q=Dresden&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250623_0700%22", "title": "From ruins to resilience", "caption": "The Elbe in Dresden, Germany", "copyrightonly": "© Sean Pavone/Getty Images", "desc": "Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in eastern Germany?

Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, roses scent the air, tulips line the paths, and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1904. Now spread across 55 acres, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom.", "date": "May 25, 2025", "bsTitle": "Bloom where you're planted", "quiz": "/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250525_ButchartFlowers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ", "wp": true, "hsh": "8a1341f291aa87e1fe58ae674f169078", "drk": 1, "top": 1, "bot": 1, "hs": []}, {"startdate": "20250524", "fullstartdate": "202505240700", "enddate": "20250525", "url": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JotunheimenPark_EN-US4200824377_UHD.jpg&rf=LaDigue_UHD.jpg&pid=hp&w=3840&h=2160&rs=1&c=4", "urlbase": "/th?id=OHR.JotunheimenPark_EN-US4200824377", "copyright": "Jotunheimen National Park in Norway (© Marisa Estivill/Shutterstock)", "copyrightlink": "/search?q=EUROPARC&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250524_0700%22", "title": "Europe's wild side", "caption": "European Day of Parks", "copyrightonly": "© Marisa Estivill/Shutterstock", "desc": "Today, European Day of Parks celebrates the national parks and conservation areas that shape a country's natural identity.

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills.

Surfing has a long history; around 5,000 years ago in Peru, people used reed watercraft to surf the waves when they were out fishing. It was in pre-colonial Hawaii, however, that modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. Historians believe that surfing made its way to the US in 1885, when three teenage Hawaiian princes surfed on redwood boards while on a break from boarding school in California.", "date": "Jun 15, 2024", "bsTitle": "Where there's a will, there's a wave", "quiz": "/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240615_NazareWave%22&FORM=HPQUIZ", "wp": true, "hsh": "bcabbd1f99efd615c4db2d1b6b4a71e5", "drk": 1, "top": 1, "bot": 1, "hs": []}, {"startdate": "20240614", "fullstartdate": "202406140700", "enddate": "20240615", "url": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlagsDC_EN-US9363778856_UHD.jpg&rf=LaDigue_UHD.jpg&pid=hp&w=3840&h=2160&rs=1&c=4", "urlbase": "/th?id=OHR.FlagsDC_EN-US9363778856", "copyright": "Flag display at the Washington Monument, Washington, DC  (© tristanbnz/Adobe Stock)", "copyrightlink": "/search?q=flag+day+US&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240614_0700%22", "title": "Long may it wave", "caption": "Flag Day", "copyrightonly": "© tristanbnz/Adobe Stock", "desc": "Wave our national symbol today; it's Flag Day!

Alicia Keys sure knows how to serenade the vibrant, bustling life of the Big Apple. Today's homepage image takes us to Union Square in lower Manhattan. At this historic intersection, you can find statues of George Washington—the oldest statue in any park in NYC—and Abraham Lincoln, crafted by the sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. In 1882, workers exercised their rights to free speech and assembly, organizing the first Labor Day parade here. In 1997, Union Square was recognized as a National Historic Landmark due to its importance in US labor history. These days, you're more likely to see street chess players, musicians, skateboarders, dance crews, and vendors of all types in the square.", "date": "Apr 16, 2024", "bsTitle": "Sundown on Union Square", "quiz": "/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240416_UnionSquareNYC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ", "wp": true, "hsh": "8b22faec617a4a5fb99143e7679e885e", "drk": 1, "top": 1, "bot": 1, "hs": []}, {"startdate": "20240415", "fullstartdate": "202404150700", "enddate": "20240416", "url": "https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedBallBelgium_EN-US3314192425_UHD.jpg&rf=LaDigue_UHD.jpg&pid=hp&w=3840&h=2160&rs=1&c=4", "urlbase": "/th?id=OHR.RedBallBelgium_EN-US3314192425", "copyright": "The RedBall Project art installation, Centraal Station, Antwerp, Belgium (© Brit Worgan/Getty Images)", "copyrightlink": "/search?q=World+Art+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240415_0700%22", "title": "Bouncing into creativity", "caption": "World Art Day", "copyrightonly": "© Brit Worgan/Getty Images", "desc": "'Art is the queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world.'
